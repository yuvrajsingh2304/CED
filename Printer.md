Subject: Requirement of a Laser Printer for faculty in Model Laboratory  

Respected Sir  
This is to bring to your kind notice that there are 07 faculty members sharing offices in 
Model Lab, Department of Civil Engineering. For official work, taking printouts is frequently required
and it becomes cumbersome to get the service from a common source i.e. Computational Lab, and hence 
decreases efficacy.  

So, in order to promote efficiancy and sustainability in the workflow, it is requested to issue a new **Laser Printer**
dedicated to staff in Model Laboratory.  

Thanking you in anticipation.  

Yours Sincerely  
Faculty Members (Model Laboratory)   
Department of Civil Engineering   
GNDEC, Ludhiana
