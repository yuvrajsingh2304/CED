### Expected Benefits Derived and How it will be helpful to the College  

This three day International webinar was a loaded and an enriching experience. It has been instrumental in imparting me deeper 
knowledge on durability and construction aspects of concrete structures and will hence be useful for my ongoing research and regular teaching assignments at the college.
