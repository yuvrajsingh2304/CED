It is heartening to note that “Newsletter” is being published on-line, which will be a compilation of all achievements of various departments / sections. The efforts of the Editorial Team is highly appreciable and I wish to put it on record. Congratulations to all members of the Editorial Team for bringing this “Newsletter” in an excellent present form using the latest technologies suitable for such team work.
</p>
<p align=justify>
Our vision is to develop constructive thinking and analytical capabilities of every student.
</p>
<p align=justify>
The Civil Department has all along contributed not only in providing the academic excellence but also in building the basic infrastructure of this great Institute; therefore, there would not be a better time to engage in introspection and put together our achievements as well as our resolve to engage with the challenges in of future in view of rapidly changing needs and environment of our society.
</p>
<p align=justify>
Our department is committed to provide students with a strong, broad based fundamental engineering education, using cutting edge technologies and modern equipment. That coupled with dedicated efforts of staff and faculty results in excellent outcomes, which make our students shine in every nook and corner of this planet.
</p>
<p align=justify>
We also impart entrepreneurial skills in students through summer internships / workshops, so that they would drive the spirit of growth of our economy and would be able to generate employment opportunities for other qualified and skilled people.
</p>
<p align=justify>
I can vogue on behalf of my faculty colleagues and staff that we will continue to strive for greater heights in teaching and research that is relevant and shall help in nation building.
</p>
<p align=justify>
Wishing all our students a brilliant and bright future.

####  SDT on "Efficient, Trackable and Sustainable Workflow"

<p align=justify>
To address the issues associated with poor workflow, and making sure that the computer resources are used efficiently and with the provision to track changes, TEQIP-III sponsored skill development training on "Efficient, Trackable and Sustainable Workflow" was organised by Examination Branch of Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC) in association with Departments of Civil Engineering and Computer Science Engineering from December 02-08, 2020.

***The organising team of SDT during the event***  

<p align=justify>
This one week training suitable for all professionals commenced from December 02, 2020 onwards on a self-paced mode. The skill development training concluded successfully with a valedictory function. Course Co-ordinator, Dr H S Rai while briefing the proceedings of the training program which focussed on Version Control System (VCS) mentioned the diverse range of participants from the Principal of the institution, faculty members, students to non-teaching staff. In order to deliver the course content effectively and efficiently, an excellent learning platform and content management system called Moodle was used. This platform enabled the participants to learn and attain hands on experience at their own pace. The training program also encouraged peer learning by discussing doubts among participants at the dedicated forum. Furthermore, keeping in view the changing scenario, Dr Rai emphasized on paper-less and thus a sustainable approach towards documentation by using available open-source powerful tools. Adding to this, he also talked about importance of version control of these documents which was the core of this training program.
</p>
<p align=justify>
During the valedictory function, feedback from participants was taken. The participants expressed their joy in learning new skills during the training program. One of the participants, Dr K D Singh said that if implemented, such a version control system can prove to be a revolutionary step for the organisation to address issues related to effective management of documentation. Dr Sehijpal Singh, Principal, GNDEC, while addressing the audience said that efficient workflow is the need of every organisation as poor documentation often leads to mismanagement and wastage of lot of resources. He expressed his views on importance of this much needed course for addressing the said issues. Furthermore, he, as a course participant too, said that the training program was an enjoyble and a great learning experience. He congratulated the organising team for this wonderful effort and dedicated approach during the training program.
